POEMS BY Dr. A.P.J KALAM
Our mission is water
My mother called me Blue Nile
I am also named by mother White Nile
When we grew and grew we asked
Oh mother, Oh mother
Tell us, why did you name us Nile
Our mothers said lovingly
Oh our children
You travel and travel
Cross mountains, forests and valleys
Thousands of miles, enriching nine countries
you reach Khartoum
you Blue and White Niles confluence with a mission
God has commanded you to give a message
you give a beautiful message
When we rivers confluence
Oh humanity why not your hearts confluence
And you blossom with happiness.
